I am creating a website for a "ADD_COMPANY_NAME" I have not yet decided on the color scheme or theme, and I need help choosing an appropriate design. The theme should be based on the nature of the company and cater to what customers would expect to see when visiting such a website.

Project Requirements:

Technology: Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the development.

Theme & Colors: Choose a clean, professional, and trustworthy theme that aligns with the cleaning and maintenance industry. Think of colors and a style that reflect cleanliness, reliability, and professionalism.

Images: Use placeholder images from the internet that represent the cleaning and maintenance services. The images don’t have to be perfect, but they should match the company’s services. I will replace them later with high-quality ones.

Responsiveness: Ensure the website is fully responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Customer Experience: Focus on what customers typically expect when browsing a cleaning and maintenance company’s website—clarity, easy navigation, trust, and professionalism.

Company Information: Incorporate the relevant details about the company, including services, contact information, and any other essential content that would appeal to potential customers.

Once you’ve understood the requirements, feel free to proceed with the project, and don’t hesitate to ask for clarification if needed!
